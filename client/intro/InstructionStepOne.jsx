          <p>On the following pages you will see some instructions and information describing a study plus some data related to what this study found. You will be asked to indicate what you think this data is showing, given the studyâ€™s setup. This task has 2 stages:</p>
          
          <h2>1. Individual Stage</h2>
          <p>You will first give an <strong>individual</strong> answer to what you think the study results showed. It will remain private <i>for the rest of this study</i> - no one will see what you said in this stage. If you give the correct answer individually, you will earn an additional $0.50 on top of your current base payment for this study.</p>
          <p>To submit an answer as an individual, all you need to do is identify the option that you think is correct, select that option, and submit your answer.</p>
